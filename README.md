# Math 23c R Bootcamp

## What is R?

As a powerful, free language built by statisticians for statisticians, R is an important tool for data scientists and statisticians like us. R is also extremely useful for other tasks like web development through the use of packages. See https://syllabusexplorer.harvard.edu/ or https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html for examples of websites and apps built with R Shiny.

## What is RStudio?

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that allows you to write code, make graphics, access files, etc.
